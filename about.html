      <div class="card">
        <p class="muted">CyberDevs is a Sri Lanka based collective of security-focused developers and designers dedicated to building tools, educational resources and defensive solutions for the modern web. Founded with the mission to make secure technologies accessible, CyberDevs combines practical offensive security knowledge with robust engineering practices to deliver high-quality projects that help individuals and organizations better understand and protect their systems.</p>
        <p class="muted">Our team specializes in vulnerability research, automation tooling, secure web development, and responsible disclosure. We publish open tools, learning resources, and run hands-on workshops to uplift developers and students across the region. Integrity, community education, and continuous improvement are at the heart of everything we build.</p>
        <p class="muted">CyberDevs believes in ethical practice — all tools and demonstrations are provided for education and defensive purposes. If you need help securing a system, reach out via the Contact page and we will respond to arrange a consultation.</p>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p class="muted">We focus on practical, repeatable methods. Each project prioritizes documentation, safety guidance and clear licensing. Community contributions are welcomed and we maintain a public roadmap for upcoming tools and workshops.</p>
        <p class="muted">The CyberDevs collective champions open learning and responsible disclosure: research findings are shared with vendors and remediated before public advisories are issued.</p>
